# Semantic Segmentation with DeepLabV3

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for semantic segmentation using the DeepLabV3 model with a ResNet-50 backbone. The notebook demonstrates the process of loading data, training the model, and making predictions. Additionally, Ray Tune is utilized for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
